					<h2 class="p-3 mt-5">What is the Knights Tour?</h2>
					<p class="pl-5 pr-5">A <span class="name">Knight's Tour</span> is a path across a chessboard made of only legal moves a knight can take in the game of chess such that it visits every tile on the board exactly once. It is an example of a Hamiltonian Cycle. Read more about them <a href="#">here.</a></p>
					<h2 class="p-3 mt-5">How does a Knight Move?</h2>
					<img class="pb-4" src="legalmoves.jpg"><
					<p class="pl-5 pr-5">A knight has exactly 8 legal moves, shaped like an 'L', from its starting position. In Chess, a Knight may pass-over, or "jump" other pieces, but that isn't important for now. Read more about them <a href="#">here.</a></p>
					<h2 class="pb-4 mt-5">Try it yourself!</h2>
